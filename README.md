# MIPS_Processor
MIPS pipeline processor for Computer Architecture Course

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
This is the [link](https://github.com/shantanu-nigam99/MIPS_Processor/blob/master/Project%20-%201.pdf) to the problem statement.

## MODEL FILES
The [main](https://github.com/shantanu-nigam99/MIPS_Processor/blob/master/processor.v)
file is the Processor, run the testbench in this file to simulate.
There are 2 different instruction files- 
1.  [instruction1.txt](https://github.com/shantanu-nigam99/MIPS_Processor/blob/master/Instruction_memory1.txt): instructions which have data dependancy, has instructions from the problem statement.
2.  [Instruction_memory_only_add.txt](https://github.com/shantanu-nigam99/MIPS_Processor/blob/master/Instruction_memory_only_add.txt): instructions which are free from data dependancy, this helps in checking broader functionality of the processor.
